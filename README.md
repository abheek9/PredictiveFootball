__Abstract:__ In this paper, we analyze soccer data from 1888 to 2014 in order to discover trends and develop a match outcome classifier. This objectives can be broken down into two main questions: how did soccerâ€™s evolution as a sport impact scoring patterns, and would a Classifier based on the Elo rating system produce reliable, above-average results?

Most of our statistical analysis are in the associated `R` files, whereas `textcleaning.py` contains the clean-up, parsing, and plot creation from some text output.
